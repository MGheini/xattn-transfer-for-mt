Stomach bloating: Tips to reduce pain include taking anise
The link to depression is not coincidental.
People living with IBS, a disorder characterised by abdominal pain, cramping, bloating, gas, constipation, and diarrhoea, frequently suffer from anxiety and depression, which can worsen symptoms, according to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA).
"That's because the colon is in part controlled by the nervous system, which responds to stress," explains the ADAA.
If your bloating still persists, it could be a sign of a food intolerance.
Actress Spencer Grammer slashed outside Manhattan restaurant
NEW YORK -- Actress Spencer Grammer says she was trying to calm an agitated man when he slashed her in the arm and stabbed her friend in the back Friday outside a New York City restaurant.
Grammer, 36, told US Weekly that she and her friend "did what anyone else would do in the same situation" and were "attempting to prevent the altercation from escalating" when they were attacked.
Grammer and her 32-year-old friend were eating at an outside table at The Black Ant in Manhattan's East Village neighborhood around 11:30 p.m.
Friday when the man ambled up and demanded to be served as the restaurant was closing down.
Grammer and her friend were hurt as they "attempted to break up a dispute between the unidentified male and other patrons at the location," police said.
The man ran away after wounding Grammer in the right arm and her friend in the lower back with an unknown sharp object, police said.
No arrests have been made.
Grammer, who provides the voice of Summer on "Rick and Morty" and previously starred on the ABC Family series "Greek," is the daughter of "Frasier" star Kelsey Grammer and actress Doreen Alderman.
Grammer said she and her friend both expect to recover quickly.
Neither suffered serious internal injuries, she said.
In her statement to Us Weekly, Grammer thanked the first responders and Bellevue Hospital staff that treated them and noted the "incredible battle" those workers have fought against the coronavirus pandemic.
"It was very moving for us to have the opportunity to thank them in person," Grammer said.
Tory MPs accuse union chiefs of wanting civil servants to 'stay at home forever'
Tory MPs accuse union chiefs of wanting civil servants to 'stay at home forever' after defying Boris Johnson's call for them to get back into the office
Union chiefs were last night accused of wanting staff to "stay at home forever" after defying Boris Johnson's clarion call for workers to get back to the office.
Tory MPs reacted with anger after the Public and Commercial Services Union told their members to challenge bosses who ordered them back to their desks.
Former Minister Andrew Percy said it was "unacceptable" that vital public-sector work such as issuing passports was going undone while private employees had toiled to keep the country going during the coronavirus crisis.
"It's unacceptable for them to refuse to come back to work while people in distribution centres and factories around the country have continued to go to work to feed civil servants during this period," he said.
"Many of those workers would now like a holiday and can't have one because of this refusal to go back to work in offices which can be achieved safely.
"The union chiefs cannot have a policy of stay at home forever - especially not now that we know people can return to work safely."
Following the Prime Minister's call, Alex Chisholm, the Civil Service's new chief operating officer, last week told all ministries that it was time to "change the default that civil servants should work from home and accelerate the return to the workplace from August 1."
But the Public and Commercial Services Union told its 200,000 members they did not have to accept that guidance, claiming it was a political issue.
A spokesman for the PCS, Britain's largest civil service union, said the back-to-the-office demand "is not based on our members" health and safety, or on helping our economy.
It is based entirely on political pressure being exerted by some Tory MPs who are demanding that the Civil Service is used as an example to get everybody back to work.
"Our advice to members is clear: if you are working from home and you get approached by anyone in your department asking you to now go back to work, don't just accept that's what you have to do."
The dispute comes amid growing concerns over delays to passports caused by home-working, with more than 400,000 people now said to be waiting for their applications to be processed.
The Home Office has now said it will "seek to expedite" applications from Britons due to travel within the next 14 days and who have been waiting on the Passport Office for more than four weeks.
The PCS has admitted that some people are having to wait for as long as 143 days for passports but insists that "small and often cramped offices" make social distancing difficult for the Passport Office's 4,000 staff.
Former Cabinet Minister David Davis urged civil service union chiefs to "behave responsibly" and work with the Government to find way of getting people back to their workplaces.
He added that if he was in Government, he would be asking union leaders: "What are you suggesting? That you stay [at home] all summer?"
However, Mr Johnson's plea to get people back to their offices has also gone unheeded by some of Britain's top firms.
A study of big employers with a total of 400,000 staff between them found that only about 40,000 of them have returned to the workplace.
Gareth Bale's situation at Real Madrid is 'unsatisfactory for everyone', says Toni Kroos
Real Madrid midfielder Toni Kroos says Gareth Bale's situation at the Spanish side is 'unsatisfactory for everyone'.
Bale did not feature in any of the last seven games and was a peripheral figure in Los Blancos' LaLiga celebrations ahead of a summer stand-off as the player looks to stay and see out his contract and the club hope he will leave.
"There is no way to avoid the situation being unsatisfactory for everyone," Kroos told the Lauschangriff Endlich was mit Sport! podcast.
"They certainly didn't sign him to play as little as he is now.
"I think in principle he wanted to leave last summer and that the club said 'yes' in principle and then 'no' after that.
"I don't know if he's still a little angry because of that.  It's a difficult matter."
Asked if the situation had a negative effect on the atmosphere at Real, Kroos said: "Certainly not as much as it might seem.
"Everything is good with the team.  I have known him for six years and we have won some important things together."
Aswan villagers collect, guard and return crashed chocolate shipment to Sudan
A truck loaded with tons of chocolate headed to Sudan rolled over on the Aswan-Abu Simple International Road on Sunday, in front of Wadi Karkar Village entrance, with the driver falling into a coma brought on by heatstroke.
Villagers rushed to the scene to attend to the fallen driver and retrieve the fallen shipments.
One of them, Alaa Bahr, explained his view that the driver was "a passerby in front of our village; we could not leave him alone.
We should help anyone, whatever their identity, if they are in distress."
He added that the villagers brought an ambulance to retrieve the driver, and then attempted to retrieve the truck's goods, estimated to be worth three million LE.
According to Bahr, the villagers stayed at the scene from morning to night retrieving as many shipments as they could.
"The most important thing for us was to save the driver's life, protect the shipment, and open up the international road," he explained.
The villagers were more than ready to bring water and shelter the injured driver, Bahr said, adding that all they wanted was to ensure that he would enter and leave the village safely.
50 People To Be Allowed In Mosques On Eid, No Mass Prayers In Eidgah: Karnataka
Eid-ul-Azha, also known as Bakrid, would be celebrated on July 31 and August 1.
The Karnataka government has allowed Eid-ul-Azha prayers only in mosques with a maximum of 50 people at a time and said mass prayers at Eidgah and other places are prohibited in view of the coronavirus pandemic.
People visiting mosques for the prayers have to wear face masks and maintain social distancing, Minority Welfare and Wakf Department Secretary AB Ibrahim said in an order.
It said the Hilal committee has decided that the Eid-ul- Azha, also known as Bakrid, would be celebrated on July 31 in Udupi, Dakshina Kannada and Kodagu districts while it would be on August 1 in the rest of the state.
Noting that mass prayers were one of the important rituals Muslims perform during Bakrid, the order said in view of the COVID-19 pandemic such events at Eidgah and other places were prohibited.
However, prayers would be allowed in mosques with the restriction that not more than 50 people should take part.
If there were more people, the prayers should be performed in batches, the department said in the order.
Mass prayers should not be performed in any other places such as halls, community buildings and "Shadi Mahal," the order added.
Karnataka allowed temples, mosques and other places of worship to be open for devotees from June 8 with all COVID-19 preventive measures in place.
Malaysia searches for 24 Rohingya feared drowned off island
KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) - Malaysian authorities said Sunday that they were searching for two dozen Rohingya refugees who are feared to have drowned after jumping off their boat off the northern resort island of Langkawi.
Zawawi Abdullah, a senior official with the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency, said initial police information showed that only one of 25 Rohingya men who jumped off the boat had managed to swim ashore.
The lone survivor sought help from police late Saturday and has been detained for further investigation, Zawawi said.
Hundreds of thousands of Muslim Rohingya have fled Myanmar due to a military crackdown, and many live in densely crowded refugee camps in Bangladesh.
Muslim-dominated Malaysia has been a common destination of boats arranged by traffickers who promise the refugees a better life abroad.
Zawawi said two vessels and an aircraft were deployed in the search.
He said the agency will also alert local fishermen and authorities in neighboring Thailand to assist in the search.
He didn't provide further details on the boat.
Last month, Malaysian authorities detained 269 Rohingya refugees and found a body on board a suspected smuggling boat off Langkawi that they said had been intentionally damaged so it couldn't be turned back to sea.
The Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency later said that the 269 were transferred from a larger vessel on which dozens of people were believed to have died and their bodies thrown into the sea.
Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said Malaysia cannot accept any more Rohingya refugees as it struggles with an economic slowdown due to the coronavirus pandemic.
But he said those already in the country will not be sent back out to sea.
Malaysia is home to over 2 million illegal immigrants as well as some 180,000 refugees and asylum seekers - including 101,000 Rohingya - who are registered with the U.N. refugee agency.
History focus can play an important role in reconciliation
Divides have deepened when understanding and healing should be our goals.
Our school system is partly to blame for this failure of knowledge and understanding.
Far too little Australian history is taught.
In fact, without radical action, the only school subject that focuses specifically on our history - "Australian history," at year 12 - will die within the next five years, maybe sooner.
Last year, of 49,324 Victorian students to complete the VCE, only 628, or 1 per cent, did Australian history.
Over the past six years, this figure has been almost halved, with almost 100 fewer students enrolling every year.
A key reason why so few students choose to study Australian history in year 12 is that little has been done in earlier years to fire their passion.
History is not even a standalone learning area, but is subsumed within the broader "humanities."
So across years 7 and 8, students complete only one short unit on ancient "Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and culture."
Then, in years 9 and 10, there is another unit focusing on Australia during the world wars.
For many Victorian students, that is the sum of Australian history taught across their secondary years.
At years 9 and 10, there is another optional unit covering the period from 1750-1918.
Three actions should urgently be taken to save Australian history in Victorian schools.
First, history must become a standalone learning area like English, maths and science.
Because history is taught only as part of the humanities, it is given little space within the curriculum.
It is also normally taught by humanities generalists who have not studied history themselves.
Historical skills, such as the analysis of evidence, are complex.
We must recruit more specialist history teachers to make sure these are taught in an accessible and exciting way.
Third, the study of Australian history from 1788 to 1914 must become compulsory.
Students love familiarity.
So many of my former students decided against Australian history in year 12 because they would have had to learn the content from scratch.
Knowledge of our history alone will not bridge our deep racial divides.
But without it, as the Victorian curriculum makes clear, the task is hopeless.

White Lines star Laura Haddock, 34, goes house-hunting with her 28-year-old lover Tom Rhys Harries
They started dating on the set of White Lines, a drama about debauchery on Ibiza - but when Laura Haddock and her boyfriend Tom Rhys Harries went house-hunting last week, they cut an image of relaxed calm far from the hedonism of the party island.
The couple, who played brother and sister in the hit Netflix series, were spotted as they viewed a stunning Oxfordshire farmhouse, which is on the market for £1.2 million.
They arrived in a Range Rover driven by Laura, 34, wearing denim shorts and a white top, and were met by an estate agent who ushered them inside for a look around the five-bedroom home.
In White Lines, which was filmed last autumn, Laura played Zoe Walker, who discovers the seedy side of Ibiza as she investigates the murder of her DJ brother Axel, played by 28-year-old Tom.
News of their relationship only emerged earlier this month, less than a year after the collapse of Laura's six-year marriage to Sam Claflin, who starred in The Hunger Games films.
Together they have a son, four-year-old Pip, and a daughter Margot, two.
When they announced their split last August, Claflin, 34, wrote on Instagram: "Laura and I have decided to legally separate. We will move forward with nothing but love, friendship and a deep respect for one another whilst we continue to raise our family together."
Laura and Sam first met in 2011 at an audition and Sam, who's also been in Peaky Blinders, described their marriage in 2013 as "easily one of his greatest achievements."
Before White Lines, Laura appeared in the first Inbetweeners film and last year's BBC crime-drama The Capture, playing lawyer Hannah Roberts.
Tom has appeared in the Inbetweeners sequel and Sky drama Britannia.
Ex-royal couple 'felt snubbed' in Queen's Christmas speech, new book claims
MEGHAN Markle and Prince Harry "felt snubbed" by his grandmother, The Queen, during her Christmas speech.
The couple's new biography, Finding Freedom, claims they felt left out of the photo collection on show in the festive address.
Pictures on the desk that The Queen was sitting at included Prince William, Kate Middleton and their three children, Prince Charles and his wife Camilla along with Prince Philip.
Yet, Meghan and Harry were nowhere to be seen having welcomed Archie last May - although the youngster did get a mention as Her Majesty's 'eighth great-grandchild'.
The new book - which is set to be released in August - also reveals that Meghan and Kate Middleton "were never friends" as they "struggled to move past distant politeness" and they only met up on a few occasions.
It was claimed yesterday that Prince Harry's split with his brother William started years before his romance with Meghan - and that it came to a head over William's marriage to Kate Middleton.
The Duke of Sussex felt like a "spare part" at events with his brother and Kate Middleton - with it claimed, "long before Meghan he wanted to change things."
Maurice Petty, Hall of Fame engine builder, dies at 81
KANSAS CITY, Kan.  (AP) - Maurice Petty, part of a stock car racing dynasty that includes father Lee and brother Richard and the first engine builder to be inducted into the NASCAR Hall of Fame, died Saturday.
He was 81.
Petty's family did not disclose the cause of death.
No funeral arrangements have been announced.
While other family members were acclaimed for their ability behind the wheel, Maurice Petty earned the nickname "The Chief" for his ability to turn a wrench.
He helped his family win 198 races and seven championships in NASCAR's premier series, and he also built engines that carried Hall of Famer Buddy Baker, Jim Paschal and Pete Hamilton to victory.
"The Chief was one of the most talented mechanics in NASCAR history," chairman and chief executive Jim France.
"He provided the power that helped Petty Enterprises define dominance in sports.
While he was known for his work under the hood, Maurice played multiple behind-the-scenes roles, doing what it took to help deliver his cars to victory lane."
Maurice Petty was born March 27, 1939, in Level Cross, North Carolina.
He would tail his father to the track while growing up, and his mechanical know-how soon played an integral part in Lee Petty winning 54 races and three championships.
He made 26 starts in the NASCAR Cup Series from 1960-64, finishing in the top 5 seven times with 16 top-10 runs.
But he quickly decided to focus on what happened under the hood rather than what happened behind the wheel, and that proved to be a good move for his older brother, who would rely on his engines during his period of dominance.
Richard, who would take on the nickname "The King," won his first championship along with The Chief when he drove a Plymouth to the 1964 title.
They won again in 1967, back-to-back titles in 1970 and "71, and added three more before the 1970s drew to an end.
The seven titles remains tied with Dale Earnhardt and Jimmie Johnson for the most in history.
"Maurice Petty was one of the true pioneers in NASCAR who helped build one of NASCAR's dominant teams in Petty Enterprises," Hall of Fame executive director Winston Kelley said in a statement.
"Although the record shows 212 victories, Petty has well over 250 wins to his credit considering all the engines he built for his competitors.
Chief will forever be remember as one of the best to build power plants in NASCAR."
Lee Petty died in 2000 and Maurice Petty's wife of 52 years, Patricia, died in 2014.
He also was the uncle of former driver and broadcaster Kyle Petty and Truck Series crew chief Trent Owens.
"While we have lost one of NASCAR's true, gritty pioneers and heroes, Maurice Petty's legacy and memory will always be remembered, preserved, celebrated and cherished," Kelley said.
"We offer our sincere condolences to the Petty family."
Google Pixel 4 able to photograph Milky Way
Along with adding 2x optical zoom, the second lens allows the Pixel 4 to see in 3D; thus doing a better job of blurring the background in portrait mode than previous Pixel handsets, which relied purely on software to achieve this "bokeh" effect.
To establish the camera's credentials, Google brought legendary portrait photographer Annie Leibovitz on stage to talk about her experience shooting with the Pixel 4 over the past 12 months.
Machine learning is still a strong focus for every aspect of Google's new smartphones, relying on "computational photography" to improve its HDR+ mode by combining up to nine different images.
New dual exposure controls offer separate sliders for brightness and shadows, allowing users to preview HDR+ in real-time.
The phone also relies on machine learning for improved auto white balance and an enhanced Night Sight night mode, which is sensitive enough to capture the Milky Way in the night sky.
Beyond the second camera lens, the Pixel 4 introduces a Soli "radar chip" front sensor which recognises Motion Sense gestures, allowing users to skip music, dismiss timers, snooze alarms or silence their phone with a wave of their hand.
All Motion Sense computations run in the device rather than connecting to the internet, as does the improved Google Assistant, as the tech giant focused on both reducing response times and enhancing user privacy.
Google's continued push to make the most of its machine learning capabilities has also spawned a new voice recorder app which transcribes audio live, without sending data to the internet.
For now the app only supports in English, with more languages to come.
The Pixel 4 will also be the first phone to support the Google Stadia cloud gaming platform, which opens its doors on November 19 in the US but is yet to receive an Australian launch date.
Beyond the new Pixel handsets, Google also unveiled a new Pixelbook Go Chromebook and second-generation Google Pixel Buds.
Arriving next year, but not confirmed for Australia, the new Bluetooth 5.0 smart earbuds are completely wireless and feature adaptive audio which monitors your environment and continually adjusts the sound to provide optimal clarity.
The new Bluetooth 5.0 smart earbuds are completely wireless and adjust the sound to the noise levels around you.
Meanwhile, Google also announced an upgrade to its mesh Wi-Fi home routers in the Nest WiFi, relying on a new separate router combined with several base stations working in unison to improve wireless coverage through the home.
Adopting the Nest name, the new Wi-Fi system doubles the range of its predecessor and adds a built-in microphone and speaker for using Google Assistant on each base station around the home.
It launches in Australia on November 5, for $399 with the router and one Wi-Fi point, or $549 AUD with a second Wi-Fi point.
The Google Home Mini also received an upgrade, with the new $79 Nest Mini improving sound quality - doubling the bass - and adding an integrated wall mount.
All Google smart speakers are set to receive a new intercom feature for communicating between devices in the home, plus the ability to call the Nest Mini from outside the home using the Google Home app.
Police: Man fatally shot at protest in Texas
AUSTIN, Texas (AP) - A man was fatally shot at a protest in Texas when he approached a vehicle and the driver inside opened fire, police said.
The shooting happened just before 10 p.m. during a protest in Austin, police spokesperson Katrina Ratliff told reporters early Sunday.
The man was taken to a hospital where he was later pronounced dead.
The vehicle had honked, turned down a road and then sped toward protesters, witness Michael Capochiano told the Austin American-Statesman.
The man, who Capochiano said was carrying a rifle, approached the vehicle and was shot by the driver.
The driver then drove away, Capochiano said.
Initial reports indicated "the victim may have been carrying a rifle," Ratliff told reporters, adding that the suspect was detained and was cooperating with police.
The crowd gathered Saturday for a Black Lives Matter protest, news outlets reported.
The demonstration was streamed live on Facebook and captured audio of a vehicle's horn honking and several gunshots being fired.
Donald Trump admits he often regrets his Twitter rants
Donald Trump has admitted he frequently regrets the incendiary posts he makes on Twitter.
Speaking to Barstool Sports Friday, the President of the United States admitted that his unchecked retweets - which have included pro-white supremacist material - get him in the most trouble.
Asked by journalist Dave Portnoy if he regretted his posts, Trump answered: "Often, too often.
It used to be in the old days before this, you'd write a letter and you'd say this letter is very big.
You put it on your desk and then you go back tomorrow and you say, "Oh, I'm glad I didn't send it," right?
But we don't do that with Twitter, right?
We put it out instantaneously, we feel great, and then you start getting phone calls - "Did you really say this?"
I say, "What's wrong with that?" and you find out a lot of things."
Last month, Trump sparked fury after retweeting (sharing content from another account) a video of his supporters in The Villages area of Florida, with the elderly pair filmed exclaiming "White power!"
And in 2017, Trump retweeted three anti-Muslim tweets posted by Jayda Fransen, leader of far-right fringe political party Britain First.
The president told Portnoy that the retweets that got him in the most trouble
Trump said: "You see something that looks good and you don't investigate it and you don't know what's on the helmet exactly, right, which is a miniature and you don't blow it up, it sometimes - I have found that almost always it's the retweets that get you in trouble."
The president often shares praise for himself, rants about his rivals and conspiracy theories with his 80 million Twitter followers.
Trump says Twitter helps him cut through so-called "fake news" reports on TV shows and newspapers he claims are riddled with falsehoods.
But the president's own lies have frequently come under the microscope, with Twitter now flagging up Trump tweets that are inaccurate.
Home form vital for Jose Mourinho as boss says it will be easier for Tottenham when fans return to stadiums
Jose Mourinho has helped Tottenham Hotspur start a new unbeaten run at home since the Premier League's restart, but he says making that home form more consistent would be easier with supporters back.
Spurs have taken 12 wins from their home fixtures this term, but were beaten four times - only one of the six teams above them lost more on home soil.
The Portuguese coach says it's possible to build those important streaks while fans are absent, but would be easier with them present.
"We need to do it with the fans. Without them you can create a kind of fortress, but based on the tactical side of the game," he said.
"But, I think with fans, you can do it in a much stronger way because you add the emotional side of the game that only your fans in your stadium can give to you."
Mourinho feels that achieving the kind of long unbeaten streaks on home soil which he enjoyed at Chelsea, or which Liverpool have built over the past three seasons, is becoming ever tougher as the opposition becomes stronger.
But it's also a crucial factor in determining whether sides achieve their respective objectives at the end of the season, particularly in close-fought or derby matches where a home atmosphere can make the difference.
"I think the Premier League is getting into a direction where these unbeaten records are something more and more difficult to achieve because of the level of the teams."
"But to be strong at home and to arrive at the end of each season with an important number of points in your pocket from home matches is very important."
"I think our recent results at home without the fans are important, but we need them back.
I can imagine that victory against Arsenal with the stadium full of Tottenham fans.
This is the kind of empathy that you can create step by step."
Section Of Jeronimo Open Space Temporarily Closes After 2 Coyote Attacks - CBS Los Angeles
Two people were bit by coyotes near Oso Creek Trail along Jeronimo Road in Mission Viejo Saturday morning, causing a temporary closure at the trail.
Laura Wittmer said she sees coyotes almost every morning when she's running and typically just tries to avoid them, but on Saturday morning, one came directly toward her and bit her on the leg.
As investigations continue into the attacks, the trail has been closed.
The City of Mission Viejo said in a tweet, "Today, 2 different parties reported coyote bites to a human.  MV Animal Services is working with the Department of Fish & Wildlife on this matter and a section of Jeronimo Open Space has been closed.  Please be aware and vigilant when you are out where wildlife is prevalent."
Wittmer tried to fight the coyote off by hitting it with a water bottle.
She called 911 to get a ride to her car but was able to drive herself to the emergency room.
The coyote disappeared into the hills but officials are hoping to track it down and check it for rabies.
Meantime, Wittmer will undergo rabies treatments as a precaution over the next two weeks.
She said the scary encounter won't stop her from her early morning runs but that from now on, she'll choose a different spot.
The condition of the other coyote bite victim is unclear.
Hunger organization pushes out Yoho after Capitol incident
WASHINGTON (AP) - A nonpartisan Christian organization that seeks to end hunger said Saturday it asked for and received the resignation of Rep. Ted Yoho from its board of directors following what it called his "verbal attack" on Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., accused Yoho, R-Fla., of using a vulgar and sexist insult while upbraiding her during a confrontation last Monday on the steps of the Capitol.
Yoho maintained he did not use the words cited, though a reporter who witnessed the incident confirmed the language as she described it.
In a statement, Bread for the World said its board met Friday with Yoho and sought his resignation "as an action that reaffirms our commitment to coming alongside women and people of color, nationally and globally, as they continue to lead us to a more racially inclusive and equitable world."
On its website, Bread for the World says its "collective Christian voice" lobbies Congress and the administration on ending hunger nationally and worldwide.
"As a bipartisan Christian organization committed to alleviating hunger and poverty through sound public policies, Bread for the World upholds the values of respect, dignity, and compassion that Jesus calls us to when engaging decision makers from across the political spectrum," the statement said.
"We believe that Rep. Ted Yoho's recent actions and words as reported in the media are not reflective of the ethical standards expected of members of our Board of Directors."
A spokesman for Yoho did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
In an extraordinary speech Thursday in the House, Ocasio-Cortez offered a dramatic account of the incident and broadened her remarks to assail what she called a sexist culture of "accepting violence and violent language against women."
More than a dozen colleagues joined her in casting the incident as all-too-common male behavior.
Yoho has described the encounter as a brief policy discussion and said that "no one was accosted, bullied, or attacked."
He expressed regret for his "abrupt manner."
Ocasio-Cortez, 30, is a freshman progressive who has gained praise and criticism for her outspokenness.
Yoho, 65, one of the most conservative members of the House, is retiring at the end of his fourth term.
Sachin Pilot Vs Ashok Gehlot; BJP Says State In Political Crisis; Congress Wants Floor Test
Ashok Gehlot said if necessary, Congress hold a sit-in outside the prime minister's home.
A day after leading a dharna at the Raj Bhawan in Jaipur, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Saturday said if necessary, the Congress MLAs will meet the President and hold a sit-in outside the prime minister's residence to settle the crisis in the state.
At a meeting of the Congress Legislature Party (CLP), Mr Gehlot indicated that the plan was to have a floor test to prove that the majority of Congress MLAs and allies are with him in the tussle for power.
"He said the government has the majority and wants to go to the assembly floor," a statement issued by Congress chief whip Mahesh Joshi after the CLP meeting said.
The CLP meeting was held at the hotel where the MLAs in the Gehlot camp are holed up for days.
"The chief minister asked us to remain prepared to stay longer at the hotel.
If required, he said, we would go to meet the President and would also hold a dharna outside the prime minister's residence," a party leader said.
The Rajasthan Governor must call an assembly session to let the Congress prove its majority, party leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday said, alleging that the BJP's conspiracy to topple the Ashok Gehlot government was now clear.
"The country is ruled in accordance with the law and constitution.
Governments are formed and run based on people's mandate.
BJP's conspiracy to topple the Rajasthan government is clear.
This is an insult to 8 crore people of Rajasthan.
The governor must call assembly session so that the truth comes before the country," Mr Gandhi tweeted in Hindi.
Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot told Congress MLAs on Saturday that he was ready to go to the President of India to make sure that what he calls a "BJP conspiracy" to stall a test of strength does not succeed.
Mr Gehlot, who protested for hours at Governor Kalraj Mishra's home on Friday to press for an assembly session, held meetings with Congress MLAs and his cabinet on Saturday, after which a fresh proposal was drawn up and passed by the cabinet.
Mr Mishra had last night asked Mr Gehlot to re-submit the request for an assembly session, citing six objections.
This proposal will be sent to the Governor soon.
Mr Gehlot has accused the Governor of delaying the session because he is "under pressure" to stall his government's test of strength.
As Mr Gehlot met with his cabinet, a BJP delegation led by Rajasthan BJP leader Satish Poonia and Leader of Opposition Gulab Chandra Kataria met the Governor to discuss the COVID-19 situation in the state.
Utah plane crash: A baby and 2 adults are killed in a backyard crash
The crash happened Saturday afternoon when a Piper PA-32 aircraft carrying six people crashed into a backyard in the city of West Jordan, Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Allen Kenitzer said.
Three people aboard the plane were killed, including the pilot, identified by police as 43-year-old Lee Wyckoff, his 9-month-old baby, and Milda Shibonis, 36, West Jordan police said.
The pilot's wife is in critical condition, and a 2-year-old child has critical burns.
A 12-year-old girl was treated at a local hospital and released, West Jordan Police spokeswoman Jennifer Worthen told CNN on Sunday.
A 72-year-old woman who was in a house struck by the plane is in critical condition, according to a tweet Sunday from the police department.
The crash also damaged three homes, West Jordan city spokesperson Tauni Barker said.
The cause of the crash has not been determined.
The FAA and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating.

The property comes with a two-storey, four-bedroom house that includes a huge ensuite, large enough to accommodate a couch.
The new owners will also enjoy three living areas, a renovated kitchen and an updated outdoor entertainment area overlooking the pool.
"It was the combination of the lifestyle property, being three acres, and it's right there," Mr Grgic said.
"I had some Melbourne buyers come down and they couldn't believe its proximity to everything but yet it had that rural feel.
"I actually have people who missed out and buyers that are still looking."
He said the generous shedding, which includes a double garage and separate shed which can accommodate 10-12 vehicles, was perfect for tradies or storing caravans and trailers.
Hundreds Of Demonstrators Gather In Downtown LA In Solidarity With Portland Protesters
LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) - About 300 protesters gathered in downtown Los Angeles on Saturday afternoon in support of a two-month-long movement in Portland, Oregon, where federal law enforcement officials are under scrutiny after clashes with protesters.
There were similar rallies throughout the U.S. in Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, New York and other cities.
The L.A. demonstrations were organized by the groups Refuse Fascism and Youth Liberation Front.
The crowd marched to the Los Angeles Police Department headquarters at First and Main streets, then to the Metropolitan Detention Center.
Participants also moved to the Alameda offramp of the 101 Freeway, but later left.
Some of the people in the group were seen breaking windows of the downtown federal building and federal signage has been graffitied with profanities.
At least one arrest was made during the protests.
Rep. Val Demings talks VP candidacy, blasts Trump for pardons
Congresswoman Val Demings (D-Fla.) was not shy about her willingness to serve as vice president under a potential Joe Biden administration as well as her sincere appreciation for being considered for the role.
In a live interview with BlackPressUSA as part of its #FIYAH!  Live series, the esteemed member of the Congressional Black Caucus shared her history and the work ethic and commitment that has brought her to this point, stating, "You all know my history.  I grew up the daughter of a maid and a janitor in Jacksonville, Florida."
Demings served as one of seven House Impeachment Managers during the January trial of President Donald Trump in the Senate.
Regardless of the Senate acquittal, history will forever note that he is the fourth commander-in-chief to be impeached.
The former House Impeachment Manager, replied in a February interview with NPR from her Capitol Hill office, "Was it worth it?  Every day it has been worth it."
Adding, while the verdict was disappointing, Democrats had an obligation to pursue the case regardless of outcome.
During the interview, Demings made it clear that she objects to Trump commuting the prison sentence of Roger Stone, who was convicted of lying to Congress (among other felonies) as well as his pardoning of other felons convicted of similar crimes, stating, "The gall of pardoning your friends, those who lied and cheated to cover up for your wrongdoings."
Demings heads Biden's list of potential running mates along with CBC Chair Karen Bass (D-Calif.), former Georgia State Rep. Stacey Abrams, Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Tammy Duckworth (D-Illinois), Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, former U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice and a few others.
She noted however, that just one person will decide who will run alongside Joe Biden this fall.
"That's Joe Biden."
Then, while laughing, she raised her hand to her lips in a mock whisper to those viewing the livestream, adding, "If y'all want to make a call... go ahead."
There's no doubt that regardless of one's political leanings, history will look back on this period as a season of evolution in American politics and perceptions.
This fact was not lost on Demings.
She noted that having so any women in consideration for vice presidential candidacy represents an opportunity to break through what remains of the glass ceiling - particularly when it comes to African American women.
"These are the exact opportunities that I work hard for all of my life to create for young boys and girls who may have been told they're the wrong color, don't have enough money, or are the wrong gender," she said.
The congresswoman pledged to make sure that the Democratic National Committee and the Biden campaign advertise and to work with the Black Press of America to get as many as possible out to vote.
"I will make a call to [DNC Head] Tom Perez and I will put this on the top of my list," Demings promised.
She agreed it should be done now, rather than later in the campaign.
Responding to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's suggestion that Trump might refuse to leave the White House if defeated, and a separate editorial stating that the president is positioning to pardon himself, Demings became animated, "To even suggest pardoning himself made me sick to my stomach."
"But who would ever do that other than Trump?
I think he hates the job.
It's not a job where you should be allowed to break the law and ignore the Constitution.
I think he hates the job, but he hates to lose.
I can see this president not wanting to leave the White House, but we have a way of taking care of that, and if that happens, I just want to be on the team that makes it happen."
Coronavirus row breaks out on bus as driver gets in fiery exchange over face masks
In the footage passengers and the driver onboard the Arriva bus service in Liverpool clash over the use of face masks.
The bus driver can be heard explaining to a woman that it is not his job to tell passengers to wear face masks.
The bus driver said: "It's not my job to ask everyone who comes on the bus about wearing a mask."
A witness said regarding the incident: "A man and an older woman started ganging up on her and a massive row erupted."
"The bus driver had to get out of his seat and came over to demand what was going on and he told one woman she wasn't even wearing her mask properly."
"That woman then stormed off the bus and said she was going to report the incident."
A spokesperson for Arriva said: "The safety of our customers and employees continues to be our priority.
"The wearing of face coverings continues to be mandatory for customers whilst using public transport (exemptions apply)."
"We have clear guidance and signage for customers in regards to this and all other social distancing measures in place on bus, via social media and our website."

Prince Harry news: Duke of Sussex's friend lashes out at explosive claims in new book
Mr Stott told Sky News that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle that the content within the book was no different to that in tabloids other than it was in a hardback.
The former soldier called for more focus on the good the couple do including their charity work.
Mr Stott said: "I think what we are reading here is no different from what we have read in the tabloids it is now just on a hardback."
"You have got an author's persona, it is still not guaranteed that it has come from them."
"I just think it is another sort of attack like the tabloids trying to persecute them."
"I understand they are in the public eye and people wish to know what they are doing but I wish the focus was more on the good that they do and the charity work rather than their intimate privacies."
"But because of who they are they will never get away from that of course."
On Saturday a royal historian also stated that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex supporting the Queen "overshadowed" other members of the Royal Family.
Dr Kate Williams told Sky News that the Royal Family were unable to harness Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's star power.
The royal commentator added that the Royal Family has a strict hierarchy but that public interest cannot be directed or controlled.
She continued: "The fact is that whatever they did to support the Queen would often overshadow other members of the Royal Family and that was seen as a problem."
"They have this huge star power."
"They had a small wedding than most siblings in the same position, Andrew had a huge wedding, Anne had a huge wedding."
"They had a small wedding but still the coverage of Harry and Meghan's wedding even though it was smaller was still as big as William's and Kate's because there is a worldwide fascination with them."
Cease-fire in war-torn eastern Ukraine to begin at midnight
KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian and rebel forces in war-torn eastern Ukraine have started preparing for a "full and comprehensive" cease-fire scheduled to begin at midnight, a move that officials hope can lead to more steps to resolve the 6-year-old conflict.
Rebel officials said Sunday they have instructed their troops about the cease-fire and issued a decree banning the use of weapons.
Ukraine's military said their forces "have begun preparations" for the ceasefire.
If upheld, it would "pave the way for implementing other clauses" of the Minsk peace deal, the office of Ukraine's president said earlier this week, calling the cease-fire a "breakthrough."
Brokered in 2015 by France and Germany, the Minsk peace plan aimed to resolve the conflict between Ukraine and Russia-backed separatists that flared in 2014 after Russia's annexation of Crimea and its support for the separatists.
The conflict has since killed more than 14,000.
The presidents of Russia and Ukraine both commended the cease-fire deal in a phone call Sunday and underscored the importance of implementing the agreements reached at the December summit in Paris.
Russia President Vladimir Putin expressed concern over Kyiv's calls to revise the Minsk agreements and said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's "position about the non-alternative nature of the Minsk agreements, once again voiced during this call, should translate into real actions," the Kremlin said.
Zelenskiy in turn, stressed the need "for further practical steps" aimed at releasing Ukrainians who are imprisoned by rebels in eastern Ukraine, in the annexed region of Crimea and in Russia, according to a statement by his office.
The 2015 deal envisaged that Ukraine can regain control over its border with Russia in the separatist-held regions only after they are granted broad self-rule and hold local elections.
The accord helped reduce the scope of hostilities, but Ukrainian forces and the rebels have continued to exchange artillery salvos and gunfire.
In December, the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany met in Paris for another round of talks, expressing support for the Minsk deal and agreeing to revive the peace process.
Zelenskiy, who won the 2019 election on promises to end the conflict, wanted Ukraine to get control of its border first before local elections, but the Kremlin has insisted the deal should be implemented without revisions.
The new cease-fire deal was reached Wednesday by members of the Tripartite Contact Group that includes representatives of Russia, Ukraine and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and was welcomed by EU officials.
During his traditional Sunday blessing in St. Peter's Square, Pope Francis also commended the cease-fire, adding that it needed to be put into practice ″to rebuild confidence and lay the foundations for a much needed and long awaited reconciliation with the people.″
Will Prince Andrew be named in new sex dossier?
Royal prepares to fight back against possible disclosure in court documents about his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell
US Judge ordered release of secret documents relating to Epstein and Maxwell
The 80 pages of documents contain sections of Maxwell's 2016 testimonies
Release of the pages could also heap pressure on Prince Andrew as they include communications between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015
Virginia Roberts, an alleged sex slave of the shamed US financier, claimed in 2015 court papers that she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew
Prince Andrew is preparing to fight back against the possible disclosure this week of further damaging allegations about his friendship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and alleged accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell.
US District Judge Loretta Preska last week ordered the release of 80 secret legal documents, running to hundreds of pages, relating to Maxwell and Epstein.
The publication of the vast tranche of papers would be a blow for Maxwell, 58, as they feature large sections of testimony she gave to lawyers in 2016, including what her legal team said was "intrusive questioning" about her sex life.
They could also heap pressure on Prince Andrew because one of the documents includes communications between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015, when Virginia Roberts, an alleged sex slave of the shamed US financier, claimed in court papers that she was forced to have sex with the Prince on three occasions.
Andrew has repeatedly and strenuously denied the claims.
A leaked email from 2015 that was revealed last year by the BBC appears to suggest that Andrew asked for Maxwell's help in dealing with Ms Roberts's claims.
We have no doubt the Duke will be vindicated
In it, he told the socialite: "Let me know when we can talk.  Got some specific questions to ask you about Virginia Roberts."
Maxwell replied: "Have some info.  Call me when you have a moment."
Last night, a source close to Andrew said: "The Duke of York has done nothing wrong, so we are relaxed about the unsealing of any court documents.
As the US courts have been at pains to point out, just because an allegation is included in court papers does not make them true.
"The US courts have urged the media and public to treat any allegations contained in court papers with extreme caution.
We entirely concur.
We have no doubt the Duke will be completely vindicated in the weeks ahead."
Maxwell is being held in Manhattan's Metropolitan Detention Center awaiting trial for recruiting and grooming some of Epstein's underage victims between 1994 and 1997.
She is also accused of perjury for denying knowledge in legal depositions of his abuse.
She denies all the allegations.
Maxwell was interviewed by lawyers in April and July 2016 as part of a defamation lawsuit brought by Ms Roberts, who now goes by her married surname Giuffre.
About 40 of 418 pages of that testimony were made public last year, but following last week's ruling by Judge Preska in New York, further sections could be unsealed as early as Thursday.
Maxwell's lawyers were given a week to file an appeal.
Epstein was found dead in his New York prison cell last year while he was awaiting trial for sex offences.
South Africa: Ashwell Prince and Marsha Cox Speak On Experiences of Discrimination
Over the last few weeks it has become evident that are many skeletons in relation to racial discrimination in South African sport.
Constructive conversations need to be had and action has to be taken in order to forge more inclusive sports.
Former Proteas batting star Ashwell Prince has lashed out at his former white team mates, accusing them of racial bias by labelling him and other black squad members as "quota players."
Prince said that in the Proteas team black players were openly labelled "quota players" by their white teammates.
Adding that it is sad that even when black players such as Makhaya Ntini and now Kagiso Rabada who ascended to the pinnacle of the game, they still have the quota tag attached to them by some people.
Prince, the current coach of the Cape Cobras franchise, made the comments on a webinar hosted by the United Coalition for Sport and Community Based Organisations (UCSCBO) on Thursday night.
The organisation aims to further the raging conversation of historic racial discrimination in South African sports.
"Like I said in my social media outburst, it's not my idea to come and drag people's names through the mud, but these are real incidents...
MATCHDAY: Final day of Premier League; Juve can seal title
A look at what's happening around European soccer on Sunday:
It's the last day of the season and plenty is still at stake: Champions League and Europa League qualification, the final two relegation places, and the Golden Boot scoring trophy.
Manchester United, Chelsea and Leicester are fighting for the remaining two Champions League qualification positions behind champion Liverpool and second-place Manchester City.
The three teams are separated by one point and Leicester hosts United.
Wolverhampton and Tottenham are battling for a finish in the Europa League spots.
Aston Villa, Watford and Bournemouth are looking to avoid the two remaining relegation spots alongside already-demoted Norwich.
With one game left, Leicester's Jamie Vardy is the top scorer with 23 goals, two ahead of Southampton's Danny Ings and three clear of Arsenal's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.
The playoffs for promotion to the Premier League begin with Swansea hosting Brentford in the first leg of their semifinal.
Fulham plays Cardiff in the other semifinal starting Monday.
Leeds and West Bromwich have already been promoted from the second-tier Championship.
Juventus can win a record-extending ninth successive Serie A title with a win over Sampdoria.
That would take the Bianconeri seven points clear of second-placed Inter Milan with two matches remaining.
At the other end of the table, Lecce needs a win at Bologna to boost its chances of avoiding relegation.
Lecce is four points below 17th-placed Genoa, which has played a game more.

Longtime staffer of Rep. Vern Buchanan dies of coronavirus
"Gary was the consummate professional and a true public servant in every sense of the word," Buchanan said on Facebook.
"He touched so many lives and was loved and respected by those who knew him.
I will never forget his uplifting spirit, sense of humor and sheer joy at helping others."

Florida has reported 414,511 cases since the start of the pandemic, above New York's 411,200, according to state health agencies.
The number of hospitalizations has increased by 79% since the Fourth of July, data from the state's health care administration shows.
At least 50 hospital intensive care units in Florida have reached capacity on Saturday, the agency's data shows.
"We've advised that's something that could make an impact," DeSantis said in June.
"At the same time, to do police and put criminal penalties on that is something that probably would backfire."
Judge denies attempt to stop order requiring release of children in immigration custody
In a Saturday ruling, Judge Dolly Gee appeared to make the upcoming deadline moot by saying that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement doesn't have to release children if the three ways outlined in her previous order can't be met.
But Gee also underscored in her order that ICE still has a duty to release children in a timely manner.
The three ways Gee had outlined included releasing families who are in ICE detention together, releasing children to a sponsor, or releasing families based upon a federal court order.
Shalyn Fluharty, director of Proyecto Dilley, an organization that offers legal services to families in detention, decried the move as allowing ICE to decide whether to continue keeping children detained.
"The bottom line for me is that kids are detained indefinitely and they have no way out unless ICE agrees to do it or families agree to be separated," Fluharty said.
Families are detained in three facilities run by ICE -- Berks in Pennsylvania, South Texas (Dilley) and Karnes County in Texas.
Children at the facilities range from ages 1 to 17, according to lawyers and advocates who provide legal assistance.
Gee -- who oversees implementation of the Flores Agreement, which governs care of children in custody -- said in June that given "non-compliance or spotty compliance with masking and social distancing rules," it was imperative to transfer children out of the facilities.
There are 969 detainees in ICE custody with positive coronavirus cases who are under isolation or monitoring as of July 23, according to ICE.
Of those, there are 25 confirmed cases in Karnes and one in Dilley, two of the family detention centers.
Overall, there have been more than 3,700 confirmed cases in custody
Seattle radio host who mocked Trump's reaction to protests now says he needs a gun after Starbucks below his apartment is trashed - RT USA News
Paul Gallant has a new perspective on violent protests after mocking President Donald Trump in June for saying anarchists were burning and pillaging Seattle.
All it took was for the mayhem to come near the talk show host's home.
"I feel like I need to buy a firearm because this is clearly going to keep happening," Gallant said Saturday night on Twitter after coming home to see the Starbucks coffeeshop below his apartment complex "destroyed" by vandals.
"Enough is enough.  It looks like a block party down the street from me.  Really angry right now."
The reaction stood in stark contrast to last month, when Trump complained that Seattle's mayor was allowing violent protesters to take over the city.
"These liberal Dems don't have a clue," the president said.
"The terrorists burn and pillage our cities, and they think it's just wonderful, even the death."
Gallant, who co-hosts the 'Danny & Gallant'show on Seattle's ESPN radio affiliate, tweeted in response: "Walked through it last night out of curiosity and saw no burning, pillaging or deaths.  Chill dawg."
Gallant said last night that police had advised residents to stay away from his apartment building because explosives could be inside the damaged Starbucks.
He posted pictures of the damage, saying, "Great job a - holes," and noted that he'd also seen a fire a few blocks away.
"Zero clue what's going on, but the cat and I are going to find out."
The turnabout didn't go unnoticed, as conservatives ridiculed Gallant for his earlier view, tweeting messages such as "Just chill dawg," and "Huh, maybe Trump was right."
Jason Rantz, another Seattle radio host, said, "Guess we're finally doing that field trip we discussed."
Gallant acknowledged the humor: "Woke up to a bunch of people tweeting 'chill dawg' at me.  I laughed."
He said he stood by his earlier statement, as he had walked through the CHAZ autonomous zone created by anarchists and found it to be less bad than it was portrayed.
"Then burning and pillaging actually happened," he said.  "Classic."

Coles ditches plastic toys for books in new collectibles campaign
"We've really listened, and it was a really key thing in formulating this program," Ms Ronson said.
"We don't think people will want to recycle the books - we think they'll want to keep them, but they can recycle them at home if they wish to."
Ms Ronson said the new campaign had been in the works long before the onset of COVID-19, and despite the pandemic, she believed the timing was "quite good" for a new campaign given the amount of time parents were spending with their children.
Analysts had been concerned shoppers were tiring of the constant collectibles campaigns from major supermarkets, but Ms Ronson said there was no sign of fatigue just yet.
"We're not seeing any of that so far, but we do constantly look out for it," she said.
"We analyse a lot of data, week to week, month to month, to make sure we're launching things that really resonate with the customer base."
Collectible campaigns such as Little Shop were primarily pioneered by Coles in Australia, with the first iteration launching in mid-2018, fuelling one of the supermarket's best-ever single-quarter sales results.
Woolworths has since followed suit with its Lion King Ooshies campaign, which also helped the supermarket supercharge its sales, and most recently, its eco-friendly Discovery Garden promotion, which offered customer free herbs and flowers to plant.
However, with UBS analysts predicting Australia's supermarket sector to have COVID-inflated sales through much of the 2021 financial year, the impact of Coles' new collectibles could be far more muted this time.
Ms Ronson said customers could expect more varied and diverse forms of collectibles campaigns into the future, with promotions such as Little Shop likely to appear less often.
"There's a lot of these collectible-type campaigns to look to around the world, and we're constantly drawing inspiration from overseas," she said.
"We should be doing those sorts of things to make sure we're constantly raising the bar with our own customer base."
Hurricane Hanna: Coronavirus-hit Texas faces new threat of catastrophic flooding in 'double whammy'
Forecasters are predicting "catastrophic flooding" in southern Texas after Hurricane Hanna made landfall twice, bringing heavy rain and winds up to 90mph.
It came ashore on Saturday as a category one storm (the lowest of the five levels) and has now been downgraded to a tropical storm - but there could still be 15-30cm (6-12in) of rain on Sunday with 60mph winds.
Some areas have already reported getting up to 23cm (9in) of rainfall, including Cameron County, which borders Mexico.
Hanna was the opening hurricane of the 2020 Atlantic cyclone season, and meteorologist Chris Birchfield warned residents to stay alert, saying: "We're not even close to over at this point.  We're still expecting catastrophic flooding."
Texas has already been dealing with a surge in coronavirus cases in recent weeks.
Governor Greg Abbott has issued a disaster declaration for 32 counties in the storm's path, including Harris, Fort Bend, Galveston and Brazoria.
He said: "Any hurricane is an enormous challenge.
This challenge is complicated and made even more severe, seeing that it's sweeping through an area that is the most challenged area in the state for COVID-19."
The first landfall happened at 5pm on Saturday, 15 miles north of Port Mansfield, which is about 130 miles south of Corpus Christi.
The second took place nearby in eastern Kennedy County.
More than 43,700 people in South Texas, including Corpus Christi, Harlingen and Brownsville, were without power on Saturday evening.
Emergency services in Corpus Christi have placed barricades near intersections so they are ready to use if streets flood.
In a tweet, President Donald Trump said his administration was monitoring Hanna, along with Hurricane Douglas, which was heading toward Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean.
Resident Sherry Boehme, who lives along a beach in Corpus Christi, said the approaching storm had increased the anxiety she felt during the pandemic.
The 67-year-old has mostly stayed at home because of health issues related to chronic lung disease.
She said: "It's almost like a double whammy to us.
I think it's made a lot of people nervous.
"We'll get through it.
Everybody is good and strong and sticks together."
Future of north Brisbane koala habitat site goes to planning court
The council said as well as being critical koala, squirrel glider and grey goshawk habitat, it was a key link between Cabbage Tree Creek and Albany Creek bushland corridors.
The property developers have appealed the council's rejection in the Planning and Environment Court, arguing the development complies with City Plan 2014 legislation, would satisfy an unmet town planning and community need and could "be undertaken without any unacceptable impacts."
Strong community opposition persists over the proposed development.
The developers, while maintaing the proposal is fully compliant with the plan, argue it could be changed to avoid any non-compliance rather than refused.
The development as it stands involves several stages, including a service station, childcare centre and 39 townhouses.
More than 120 public submissions were made during the consultation period, most objecting to the proposal as too big and inappropriate for the site.
BCC opposition leader Jared Cassidy said the council needed to buy the land to protect koalas.
"[Lord mayor] Adrian Schrinner needs to stop wasting ratepayer funds in a developer court battle and buy this land to protect Brisbane's wildlife," Cr Cassidy said.
"This is one of the most significant pieces of habitat in the Mountain to Mangroves Corridor and is home to a large koala community."
Cr Schrinner this week said the council wanted to see the koala habitat on the site protected.
"We didn't believe the proposal was appropriate for the site," Cr Schrinner said.
"This, I understand, is now going through a court process and obviously we hope to see out of that court process a good, positive outcome which will see the habitat preserved."
Cr Schrinner said koala habitat mapping was a joint responsibility between the council and the state government, with the state government responsible for detailed koala mapping used by local authorities for assessing development applications.
It's really war!
Coleen Rooney hires Johnny Depp's barrister for her Wagatha Christie battle with Rebekah Vardy
Mrs Rooney has asked David Sherborne to fight claims she defamed Mrs Vardy
After talks between WAGs failed, insiders are expecting dramatic showdown
Coleen Rooney has hired the celebrity barrister acting for Johnny Depp in his blockbuster libel case to represent her in the "Wagatha Christie" legal battle with Rebekah Vardy.
The Mail on Sunday understands that Mrs Rooney has instructed David Sherborne to fight claims she defamed Mrs Vardy with allegations that personal information was leaked from her private Instagram account to a newspaper.
The news comes days after documents submitted to the High Court claimed that Mrs Vardy, who is married to Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy, suffered physical and mental anguish as a result of Mrs Rooney's allegations.
The papers say the 38-year-old mother of five "suffered from severe panic attacks and anxiety which manifested in being scared to leave the house," adding that Mrs Vardy, who was seven months pregnant at the time, "was taken to hospital three times... as she suffered anxiety attacks as a result of the post and the repercussions of it."
As well as representing Depp in his libel action against The Sun over allegations the actor was a wife-beater, Mr Sherborne, 50, is acting for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in their privacy claim against Associated Newspapers, publishers of The Mail on Sunday.
After mediation talks between the two WAGs failed, insiders are now expecting a dramatic courtroom showdown.
"If you thought the Depp trial was box office, don't underestimate this forthcoming WAG war," said a source.
"It really is war now.  Coleen will not back down, neither will Becky.  It will be sensational stuff."
Mrs Rooney claimed that someone using Mrs Vardy's Instagram account had leaked fake stories about her to a newspaper.
She was nicknamed "Wagatha Christie" after revealing how she had she spent five months slowly limiting the number of friends who could see her updates on Instagram stories until only Mrs Vardy's account remained.
Mrs Rooney claims she then posted a fake story on Instagram, which was later published in a red-top newspaper.
In her legal submission, Mrs Vardy, who has denied involvement, alleges that she was made to feel like a "scapegoat" after Mrs Rooney posted the allegations "in a calculated and deliberate manner that was designed to cause very serious harm and enormous distress."
But Mrs Rooney's team has challenged the claim, alleging that details of her anguish are a "PR exercise" that distracts from the facts.
A source said: "Becky's papers are a sideshow, it is all so spurious."
Mrs Rooney - who has four sons with former England star Wayne Rooney - is being represented by lawyer Paul Lunt, of Liverpool-based legal firm Brabners.
Mrs Vardy is with London company Kingsley Napley, but it is unclear if she has yet instructed a barrister.
A spokesman for Mrs Rooney declined to comment.
US Racial Injustice Protests Mount
Protesters have taken to the streets of several U.S. cities to bring attention to racial injustice.
Protests in Portland, Oregon, have been going in for two months, since the May 25 death of George Floyd while in police custody in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
The Trump administration has sent federal officers to Portland, adding additional fuel to the protests.
The demonstrators now are also protesting the federal presence in the city.
In Seattle, police using flash bangs and tear gas arrested 45 people Saturday after demonstrations in support or the protests in Portland turned violent.
Police said more than 20 police officers were injured.
Saturday night, in Austin, Texas, a man was killed when someone shot into a Black Lives Matter march.
Media accounts say the man may have approached a vehicle with a rifle before he was fired upon.
"All I know is that someone dying while protesting is horrible," Mayor Steve Adler of Austin said in a statement.
Adler said he is "heartbroken and stunned."
In Louisville, Kentucky, a group of armed protesters called for justice of Breonna Taylor, a Black woman who died in Louisville when police entered her home without warning on a "no knock" warrant and shot her.
Taylor's boyfriend had fired at the officers first, thinking they were intruders.
One police officer has been fired because of the Taylor incident, but charges have not been brought against the other officers.
The leader of the NFAC group, an armed Black militia involved in the protests, says he wants the police investigation into the Taylor killing to be more transparent.
Police say three NFAC members were injured Saturday when one of the militia's weapons accidentally discharged.
Poland to withdraw from European treaty aimed at preventing violence towards women
Poland's right-wing government says it will withdraw from a European treaty aimed at preventing violence against women.
The Istanbul Convention is the world's first binding instrument to prevent violence against women but the Polish Justice Minister, Zbigniew Ziobro, described the text as "harmful" because it requires that schools teach children about gender from a sociological point of view.
Ziobro said over the weekend that on Monday he will begin preparing the formal process to withdraw from the treaty.
"This ideological element is linked to the imperative to change education in schools and outside of school programs, in terms of learning, attitudes, convictions of the young Polish generation of students to make, in our opinion, the false assumption that biological sex is archaic, and in fact everything comes down to the socio-cultural gender."
In Ziobro's opinion, the convention's articles concerning the education of children and young people as well as family relationships in the LGBT context are not acceptable.
"We also reject the LGBT element of promoting family relationships, a view propagated by activists from left-wing or homosexual circles who want to translate their beliefs into binding law," he said.
The Council of Europe said on Sunday it is "alarmed" that Poland is aiming to withdraw from the Convention.
In Warsaw on Friday, around 2,000 people including women's groups and other rights activists held a demonstration in front of the offices of Ordo Luris, a right-wing organisation that supports withdrawal from the convention.
"We will not be victims" they chanted.
Demonstrations were also held in other Polish cities.
Poland signed the Istanbul Convention for the prevention and combating of violence against women and domestic violence in December 2012 and ratified it in 2015.
"You Do the Right Things, and Still You Get It"
Paul Roberts, a former musician and carpenter turned computer programmer for NASA, now works at a software company.
He and his wife, a retired Methodist Hospital nurse who calls herself a "glass half full person," ran an online fanzine and attended Comic Con events years ago.
They gather weekly with their two daughters, son-in-law and 7-year-old grandson for jigsaw puzzles and fierce games of Uno.
"They are amazing nerds," Ms. Roman, 38, said of her parents.
Sheryl Roberts, 65, understood the perils of the pandemic - she had diabetes, asthma and heart disease, which could put her at higher risk.
Her husband had chronic lung disease and a stent to open a blocked coronary artery.
"We have been so careful, so very careful, and stayed away from people," Ms. Roberts said.
Her husband began working from home in the spring when Washington State, New York and then other areas around the country were hit hard.
Mr. Roberts occasionally made a supermarket run during "senior" hour; the couple's only "big, hot date" in recent months, Ms. Roberts said, was to view wildflowers from their car.
Their younger daughter was diligent as well.
But then she came back from work sneezing one day in mid-June and thought it was allergies.
Soon she had a cough, fever, headaches and diarrhea, and lost her senses of taste and smell, telltale symptoms of the coronavirus.
"She told me, "I don't know what's going on, Mom, but I wore a mask, I wore gloves, I washed my hands,"" Ms. Roberts said.
"You do the right things, and still you get it."
Elaine Roberts, who tested positive for the coronavirus, did not become seriously ill.
But for her parents, it would be much worse.
Mr. Roberts and his wife started sneezing, then coughing, just like their daughter, and developed fevers and severe body aches.
Then he got "awfully sick, awfully quickly," Sheryl Roberts recalled.
He became confused on June 22.
Alarmed, she tested his oxygen level.
It was low, and she called her older daughter to take him to an emergency care center, the second visit in two days.
Troops destroy bandits' camp, eliminate bandits in Zamfara State
The air interdiction missions conducted by the Air Component of Operation HADARIN DAJI have destroyed a new camp belonging to the armed gang headed by the bandit leader known as "Dangote" in the Doumborou Forest area of Zamfara State.
The Coordinator Defence Media Operations, Major General John Enenche said the airstrike, which also resulted in the killing of several armed bandits, was executed following Human Intelligence (HUMINT) reports as well as series of confirmatory aerial surveillance missions.
Major General Enenche said the HUMINT established that members of the gang, along with their logistics items, motorcycles and hundreds of rustled livestock, had relocated from their erstwhile position to the new area by a rocky high ground within the Forest.
Enenche said the Air Component, therefore, dispatched an enhanced force package of Nigerian Air Force (NAF) fighter jets and helicopter gunships to attack the location.
According to him "the attack aircraft engaged the target area scoring accurate hits and taking out some of the bandits.
Many others, who were seen trying to flee the location in disarray, were mopped-up in follow-on attacks."
While commending the Air Component of Operation HADARIN DAJI for its professionalism, the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar, urged them to remain resolute in the conduct of airstrikes against armed bandits.
The Chief of the Air Staff tasked them to continue to provide close air support for the ongoing ground operations in order to eradicate all armed bandits and restore normalcy to the North-West and North-Central zones of the Country.
Tree Branches Downed as Hurricane Hanna Passes Through Southern Texas
Hurricane Hanna weakened to a tropical storm after it made landfall on the coast of southern Texas on Saturday, July 25, but officials warned the storm still had potential to lead to "life-threatening" flash flooding.
The National Weather Service (NWS) said heavy rainfall remained the greatest threat in southern Texas and northeastern Mexico as the storm moved west-southwest on Sunday.
Jorge Castillo shared this footage on Twitter, and told Storyful he filmed this footage outside his home in Combes, Texas, on Sunday morning.
US reportedly ramps up pressure on Nord Stream 2 contractors - RT Business News
The US government has made further attempts to force European firms to ditch the Russian-led Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, Welt am Sonntag reported, citing people familiar with talks on the issue.
According to the newspaper, officials from US Department of State, the Treasury Department, as well as the Department of Energy approached European contractors to make sure they fully understand the consequences of staying in the project.
Up to a dozen officials reportedly held at least two online conferences with representatives of the firms in recent days.
Speaking in a "friendly" manner, the US side stressed that it wanted to prevent completion of Nord Stream 2, observers of the online talks said.
"I believe the threat is very, very serious," one of them revealed to the German outlet.
Those threats are consistent with comments by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last week, in which he warned that companies involved in the project had better "get out now" or risk facing penalties under Section 232 of the notorious Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).
Apart from Russia's energy major Gazprom, which is developing the project, five European companies have joined.
Those are France's Engie, Austria's OMV, the UK-Dutch company Royal Dutch Shell, as well as Wintershall and Germany's Uniper.
Speaking to Welt am Sonntag, the latter called US attempts to undermine the "important infrastructure project" a clear intervention into European sovereignty.
Earlier this week, the US House of Representatives approved an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, meant to expand US sanctions on companies involved in installing Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
According to one of the sponsors of the bill, the measures can target companies facilitating or providing vessels, insurance, port facilities, or tethering services for those vessels, as well as to those providing certification for Nord Stream 2.
Both European businesses and government officials have repeatedly decried US attempts to meddle in European energy policy by sanctioning Nord Stream 2, with some even calling on Brussels to work on countermeasures.
Moscow has also lambasted Washington's move, calling it unfair competition.
Earlier this week, presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russia will develop a new strategy for completion of the project if Washington proceeds with new punitive measures.
Sebastian Vettel to Red Bull: F1 star tipped to join Max Verstappen due to one team member
"That is a definite no I am afraid, and Sebastian is aware of that."
F1 returns next weekend with the first of two back-to-back races at Silverstone.
Lewis Hamilton will look to extend his lead after winning two of the opening three Grand Prix since the sport finally returned amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Vettel will be hoping from some improved performance from his Ferrari which has been off the pace so far.
Octavia Spencer calls on Hollywood to increase casting of people with disabilities
The actress is part of a new PSA that calls for increased inclusion of those with disabilities in entertainment.
The campaign coincides with Sunday's 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
The video shows Spencer discussing the importance of everyone being able to see themselves and their lives accurately reflected on screen.
"Nothing can replace lived experience and authentic representation," she said.
"That's why it's imperative that we cast the appropriate actor for the appropriate role."
Spencer discussed the impact she felt seeing a family of color on screen as a young girl watching the show "Good Times."
The series, which ran on CBS from 1974 to 1979, was created by Norman Lear and broke barriers as television's first African American two-parent family sitcom.
Ukraine team doctor, 48, dies from coronavirus
Anton Hudaev, the Ukrainian national team's doctor, has died from the novel coronavirus at the age of 48, the domestic football association (UAF) said.
"On behalf of the President of the Ukrainian Association of Football Andriy Pavelka, head coach of the national team Andriy Shevchenko and the entire football family of Ukraine, we extend our deepest condolences to his family," the UAF said in a statement.
"The whole national team is in great sorrow."
Hudaev was also team doctor for the local club Metalist Kharkiv.
The virus has killed more than 1,600 people in Ukraine, which has reported nearly 65,000 infections.
Delhi Metro Casts First Pier Under Phase-4 Work
The Delhi Metro has reached a major milestone in the Phase-4 work as it cast its first pier on the under-construction Janakpuri West-R K Ashram Marg corridor, officials said on Sunday.
The pier was cast at Keshopur on the elevated stretch between Keshopur and Mukarba Chowk on Saturday night.
"The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation took another important step forward in its Phase 4 construction work as the first pier of this phase of Metro expansion was cast on the Janakpuri West-R K Ashram Marg Metro corridor," the DMRC said in a statement.
This "major construction milestone" has been achieved, despite severe shortage of manpower and other logistical challenges because of the pandemic, officials said.
The average height of piers on this corridor is 10m.
However, piers will be 20m high at Madhuban Chowk (crossing with Line 1) and 25m at Haiderpur Badli Mor where this line will cross Line 2.
At Haiderpur Badli Mor, the viaduct level is going to be at 28m, the highest in the history of Delhi Metro, the statement said.
Presently, the highest point is at Dhaula Kuan, where the Line 7 viaduct passes at a height of 23.6m.
Piers, in terms of civil engineering are vertical loadbearing structures which act as intermediate support for adjacent ends of two spans.
They form the vertical support structures on which the elevated metro viaducts stand.
Metro piers today dot innumerable road medians in Delhi through which elevated Metro corridors run.
Pier numbers are now important landmarks for addresses across the Delhi-NCR.
The 28.92-km-long Janakpuri West-R K Ahsram Marg corridor is an extension of Magenta Line and will come up with 22 stations.
While 21.18 km of this corridor will be elevated, 7.74 km will be underground.
Construction work on this particular section had started in December last year.
On July 17, the work on the underground section of this corridor was commenced with the beginning of D Wall construction work at the Krishna Park Extension Metro station.
On 24th June, DMRC had started the casting work of u-girders which would be installed on the elevated section of this corridor.
Under Phase-4, 61.679 km of new metro lines shall be constructed across three different corridors comprising 45 metro stations.
These new sections shall provide interconnectivity among the already operational sections of Delhi Metro.
Out of this, 22.35 km will be underground while rest will be elevated.
Anti-racism protesters clash with police in Seattle
Clashes in Seattle between police and anti-racism protesters resulted in dozens of arrests on Sunday, as public anger mounts over US President Donald Trump's planned "surge" of federal agents into main cities.
Demonstrations against racism and police brutality have been ignited by the death in Minneapolis of unarmed African-American George Floyd in May.
Protesters in Seattle slashed car tires and smashed trailer windows during the demonstrations on Saturday, prompting police to declare a riot and clear the streets with pepper spray and flash-bang grenades.
Protesters also set fire to trailers by a construction site for a youth detention facility.
Police said 45 people were arrested while 21 officers were injured.
The march was in support of ongoing protests in nearby Portland, Oregon.
Portland has taken centre stage for the highly controversial crackdown by federal agents ordered by Trump -- one that is not supported by local officials, who say officers use excessive force.
Protesters have marched in Austin, Texas, as well as Louisville, Kentucky; New York; Omaha, Nebraska; California's Oakland and Los Angeles, and Richmond in Virginia.
In Austin, a man was killed in a shooting that broke out Saturday night at a protest in the downtown area of the Texas state capital, police said.
The protests come as Trump faces an increasingly tough battle for re-election in November, and is campaigning on a "law and order" platform.
Israelis continue protests against PM's handling of pandemic
JERUSALEM (AP) - Thousands of Israelis held several demonstrations across the country against their prime minister Saturday, with the main protest taking place in Jerusalem outside the official residence of Benjamin Netanyahu.
The protests have been going on for the past few weeks, sparked by what critics see as a government failure to handle the coronavirus crisis after initially keeping the threat of the virus at bay.
Corruption charges against Netanyahu have further fueled the demonstrations.
"Bibi, go home," read one sign held by a protester.
Another placard read "Everyone can see that the emperor has lost his clothes."
Hundreds of protesters Saturday also gathered outside Netanyahu's beach house in the upscale town of Caesarea.
Last week, police used water cannons to disperse crowds in Jerusalem.
After what has been called a hasty and erratic reopening of the economy in May, infections shot up with the average number of new cases daily at 2,000.
The country's economy has been battered by virus restrictions and the unemployment rate has skyrocketed to nearly 20%.
Protesters say the government's offers of financial assistance have been nowhere near enough.
The protests came in the shadow of Netanyahu's corruption trial which resumed this month.
Hearings will start in January.
He is charged with fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in a series of scandals.
Differently-Abled Homeless Women Part Of Chennai's COVID-19 Fight
Shanthi, a differently-abled master tailor, visits 250 homes everyday to identify symptomatic people in Kodambakkam, a key Covid hotspot in Chennai with around 10,000 positive cases.
Her day starts as early as 7:30 AM and finishes at around 4 PM.
She checks the temperature of residents, quizes them for symptoms, and spreads awareness on wearing masks, frequently washing hands, and social distancing.
Her efforts have even helped the early identification and recovery of four positive people.
Shanthi is among Chennai City corporation's 16,000 non-medical workers who conduct door-to-door screening.
The iniative, authorties say, has led to a 50 per cent fall in positive cases in Chennai's daily tally even as they rise in other Tamil Nadu districts.
Shanthi says not all residents are cooperative.
She adds, "Most people cooperate seeing a differently-abled woman reaching out to them.
Some feel irritated too.
I'd not be worried.
For me, people should be safe.
When I visit them again the next day they are polite.
Establishing a good rapport helps."
And there are several others like Shanthi who stay at the corportation's homeless shelter for differently abled women and help in the fight against Covid-19.
Not far away Kodambakkam, Kavitha, who is also differently-abled, has joined the effort as a supervisor.
Though she has a retrofitted bike, Kavitha walks holding her crutches to meet people.
"I am happy," she says about the decline in numbers, but adds, "I want this to come down to perhaps around 100 a day.
I'm confident we can reach that."
On the ground floor of the homeless shelter where the two stay, Matilda Funceca, a wheelchair basketball player, and Manimekalai, a school teacher, upload all the data sent by around 40 women to Chennai Corporation's server.
Matilda says she has no fear of contracting coronavirus.
"When we help others, God will protect us" she adds.
Asked about the precautions they take, Manimekalai explains: "I wear a mask, follow social distancing and do frequent hand wash.
I also take Kabasura Kudineer, Siddha immunity-boosting drink."
A few months ago, when corona first struck Chennai these differently-abled women used their time and talent to stitch masks for sanitary workers in the city.
Dr Aishwarya Rao, director of the Shelter and Dorcas Research Centre that runs the shelter, said "They adapt according to the need of the hour.
Earlier mask was needed and they rose to the occasion.
Now it's time for community intervention and they readily said yes."
Coronavirus cases in Tamil Nadu have crossed the two lakh-mark with 6,989 new cases reported in the last 24 hours, which is also the biggest single-day spike, government data shows.
Eighty-nine have died and 7,758 have recovered in the last 24 hours.
The total cases in the state is now 2,06,737.
Mick Fleetwood pays tribute to Peter Green: 'His music will live on'
Mick Fleetwood has paid tribute to Peter Green, the co-founder of Fleetwood Mac, who died today aged 73.
Green was an original member of the iconic rock group, alongside the aforementioned Mick, as well as Jeremy Spencer.
Despite leaving the band in 1970 before their greatest successes with albums like Rumours, Mick has paid tribute to his former bandmate, assuring fans that "his music will live on."
Fleetwood told PA: "For me, and every past and present member of Fleetwood Mac, losing Peter Green is monumental.
"Peter was the man who started the band Fleetwood Mac along with myself, John McVie, and Jeremy Spencer.
No one has ever stepped into the ranks of Fleetwood Mac without a reverence for Peter Green and his talent, and to the fact that music should shine bright and always be delivered with uncompromising passion."
The 73 year old rock legend added: "Peter, I will miss you, but rest easy your music lives on.
I thank you for asking me to be your drummer all those years ago.
We did good, and trail blazed one hell of a musical road for so many to enjoy.
"God speed to you, my dearest friend.......  Love Mick Fleetwood."
Confirming Green's death, a statement from Swan Turton solicitors read: "It is with great sadness that the family of Peter Green announce his death this weekend, peacefully in his sleep.
"A further statement will be provided in the coming days."
Green is survived by his daughter, Rosebud Samuels-Greenbaum, who she shared with ex-wife Jane Samuels.
Green formed Fleetwood Mac with bandmates Mick Fleetwood and Jeremy Spencer, with the band originally called Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac featuring Jeremy Spencer.
However, the singer-songwriter would leave the group in 1970, after four albums.
Fleetwood Mac would go on to achieve great acclaim and worldwide fame with additional line-ups including Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks on seminal albums including Rumours and Tusk.
Congress Was Already Broken.  The Coronavirus Could Make It Worse.
"The pandemic alone is a call to our elected officials for the type of leadership and vision we expect at a moment of crisis," says the report, which grew out of interviews conducted by Leonard Steinhorn, a professor of communication at American University, and Mark Sobol, an author and expert on organizational development and executive leadership.
"But we are also facing another reckoning, one over our nation's original sin and the racial inequities that have beset our country since its founding."
The study ticks through familiar themes when it comes to assessing the sorry state of Congress: the lack of any real across-the-aisle relationships, a schedule that limits opportunities for interaction, too much power concentrated in leadership, constant fund-raising demands, discouragement of bipartisanship, the negative influence of round-the-clock media, the fact that the most important election for lawmakers is often their primary, and the shutting out of minority-party voices.
It also warns that the shifts toward a more virtual Congress as a result of the pandemic, such as a new system of proxy voting in the House that allows lawmakers to cast their votes without traveling to Washington, could exacerbate the existing problems.
If the idea of a remote Congress takes hold, the report suggests, it would be a serious setback to efforts to enhance bipartisan interaction.
"Because of the pandemic, Congress was forced to conduct much of its business virtually, and we certainly understand why," the report said.
"But as much as that may have been a necessity, it should not be interpreted as a virtue."
The document says Congress needs "more and not less in-person interaction among members of Congress.
They need to learn more about each other's districts, hold civil conversations aimed at finding common ground, build relationships of trust that can lead understanding and solutions."
In a week when Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, was verbally assaulted without provocation by Representative Ted Yoho, Republican of Florida, and fellow Republicans ganged up on Representative Liz Cheney, Republican of Wyoming, in a hostile confrontation, the call for civility rang especially true.
Alibaba, Jack Ma summoned by Gurugram court on former employee's complaint
Gurugram, July 26: In a major development, Alibaba and its founder Jack Ma has been summoned by a Gurugram court after the company's former employee alleged that he was fired for objecting censorship and fake news on company's applications.
The case is filed in Gurugram district court and Civil Judge Sonia Sheokand has issued a summons for Alibaba, Jack Ma and about a dozen others, and has asked them to appear on July 29, as per reports.
The judge has also sought written responses from the company, Reuters reported.
Parmar, who was an employee of the UC Web office in Gurugram until October 2017, is seeking $268,000 in damages, according to court documents.
"We are unwavering in its commitment to the Indian market and the welfare of its local employees, and its policies are in compliance with local laws.
We are unable to comment on ongoing litigation," UC India stated in a statement.
"The lawsuit also contains a "sensitive words list" with key words in Hindi and English like "India-China border" and "Sino-India war" that the court filing alleges were used by UC Web to censor content on its platforms in India," Reuters reported.
Last month, the Home Ministry had banned 59 Chinese mobile apps including UC News, UC Browser amidst border tensions between the two countries.
Francois Bozize, deposed CAR leader, announces presidential bid
Deposed former Central African Republic President Francois Bozize announced on Saturday his candidacy for the December presidential vote despite being under United Nations sanctions and subject to an arrest warrant for alleged crimes against humanity.
He made the announcement in a speech to a large crowd of supporters at a congress of his party, Kwa na Kwa (Work, Nothing But Work), in the capital Bangui.
The 73-year-old former general and army chief was overthrown in a 2013 rebellion by a coalition of mainly Muslim rebels from the north, plunging the majority Christian nation into a violent civil war and an acute and continuing humanitarian crisis.
"The country needs a man of experience, peace and conviction," Bozize said in the speech that criticised the tenure of the current president, Faustin-Archange Touadera.
Bozize first took power after a 2003 coup and served 10 years as president before fleeing the country in 2013.
The new administration sought his arrest for alleged crimes against humanity and incitement to genocide, but has not moved to arrest him since he returned from exile late last year.
It is not clear how the warrant or foreign sanctions will affect his candidacy.
In January, Bozize said he would ask the UN to lift the sanctions imposed in 2014 over his alleged support for Anti-balaka Christian armed groups.
Touadera governs today with the support of a large UN peacekeeping operation with more than 13,000 troops and police.
Elected in 2016, he is expected to seek a second term in the election but has not yet confirmed he will run.
The first round of the race is scheduled for December 27.
The government signed a peace deal in February 2019 with 14 armed groups, who typically claim to defend the interests of specific communities or religions.
Violence has since generally receded, but there are still bloody incidents, typically sparked by fighting over resources and most of the diamond-rich country remains beyond government control.
The violence has forced more than 1.5 million people to flee their homes.
Gottlieb warns uncontrolled coronavirus spread in a community makes it "very hard to open" schools in fall
Washington - Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former head of the Food and Drug Administration, warned Sunday it's going to be "very hard" for school districts to open for the upcoming academic year if there is uncontrolled spread of the coronavirus within their communities.
"For local school districts, I think they need to be looking at what is the spread within the community.
If you have uncontrolled spread within the community, it's going to be very hard to open against that backdrop." Gottlieb said on "Face the Nation."
With the fall semester set to begin in the coming weeks, the Trump administration had been urging school districts to open their doors to students for in-person instruction five days a week.
But the push from President Trump and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos comes as Mr. Trump warned last week the coronavirus crisis will likely "get worse before it gets better" and acknowledged school districts in hot spots may have to delay reopening for a few weeks.
Still, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidance Thursday for how best to safely open schools for students.
The guidance calls for schools to follow social distancing, recommend students and staff wear face coverings, and keep students in defined groups to reduce contact with others, among other guidelines.
But the CDC did not provide a benchmark for school administrators on when they should move to close a school in the event of an uptick in coronavirus infections, which Gottlieb said was "unfortunate."
"In the setting of uncertainty and the lack of specific guidance for how to keep schools open, I think more parents are going to err on the side of caution," he said.
"That's why it's very important to get specificity out of what the hard metrics are that the CDC didn't do in its guidance."
Gottlieb said school districts should think about positivity rates in their community, local spread and testing capacity to guide decision-making on whether to keep a school open or shift fully to online learning.
A positivity rate between 5% to 10%, he said, is "starting to get iffy," while above 10% is the "threshold where you really want to think carefully about closing the school districts."
"That is a sign that there is an epidemic underway inside that community," Gottlieb said, adding that it's going to be difficult for parts of Florida, which is an epicenter of the coronavirus epidemic in the U.S., to open their schools for in-person learning next month.
More than 30 states and the District of Columbia are experiencing an uptick in coronavirus infections, with the epicenter of the epidemic currently in the Sun Belt.
But Gottlieb said there are indications cases in some states including Arizona and Texas are beginning to plateau.
While Gottlieb said there are "unmistakable signs" the epidemic is slowing in some states across the Sun Belt, it's "heating up" in others, including South Carolina, Alabama, Indiana and Illinois.
Many governors have instituted mandates requiring people to wear masks when they are in public spaces and halted their phased reopenings in an effort to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus.
Gottlieb said states should consider shutting down bars, limiting the number of people in restaurants, closing movie theaters and other kinds of indoor entertainment venues, and implementing mask mandates to quell the epidemic, steps that allow states to stop short of reverting back to the more stringent restrictions imposed at the start of the pandemic in March.
In addition to states issuing mask mandates, a number of businesses are requiring customers to wear face coverings as well.
McDonald's is among the latest to require face coverings, and the fast food giant joins Walmart, Starbucks and others in implementing their own rules for masks.
Gottlieb said he expects more businesses will implement mask mandates in venues, especially those considered high-risk.
"If we really can manage to keep the epidemic under control heading into the winter until we get to a vaccine or some kind of therapeutic that changes the clinical trajectory of this illness, just with masks that's going to be something relatively simple that we can all do that doesn't really change our lives and allows us to maintain what's really important to us like keeping some businesses open, like getting our kids back to school," he said.
While Mr. Trump has said he will not impose a nationwide mask mandate, he urged Americans last week to wear coverings, saying during a White House press briefing "they have an impact."

Khamzat Chimaev is being hailed as a UFC star-in-waiting after making history on Fight Island, but the Russian-born fighter says he is not planning any ostentatious displays of wealth similar to the likes of Conor McGregor.
Chimaev overwhelmed Northern Ireland's Rhys McKee in their welterweight contest in Abu Dhabi on Saturday night, finishing his opponent with a ground-and-pound barrage 3 minutes and 9 seconds into the first round.
The win ensured Chimaev etched his name into the UFC history books by claiming the shortest-ever period between victories in the modern era of the promotion, coming just 10 days after he defeated Britain's John Phillips in similarly destructive fashion - on that occasion at middleweight.
The 8-0 Chimaev pocketed a $50,000 Performance-of-the-Night bonus for his work against McKee and has firmly earned the attention of the MMA world, being tipped as 'Khabib 2.0' - a perhaps inevitable comparison given Chimaev displays a similar oppressive dominance to the UFC lightweight champ, and was born in Chechnya, which neighbors Khabib's own Dagestani homeland.
Despite the newfound fame and financial boost, the softly-spoken Chimaev said he would not be prone to shows of wealth along the lines of MMA money-man Conor McGregor or his boxing equivalent Floyd Mayweather Jr.
"I do this not only for me, I do this for everybody I can help.
I don't want to be like Mayweather and McGregor, to show my money or something like that.
I want to help people," replied Chimaev when asked on Fight Island about how he would spend his bonus.
One man he has gained the attention of is Conor McGregor teammate and arch Twitter protagonist Dillon Danis, who took to the platform to claim he could submit Chimaev "easily."
That drew a withering response from the fighter known as 'Borz' - or 'wolf' in his native Chechen - who said he would "smash Danis with his eyes closed."
Chimaev, who now fights out of Stockholm, Sweden, having moved to the country at the age of 19, may be modest in displaying his financial ambitions but is distinctly less shy when it comes to his fighting prospects.
"I can smash everybody...
How many fighters in the welterweight division?
I can smash all of them," he said.
"Give me 77 kilos (welterweight) champion, 84 kilos (middleweight) champion, I'm going to smash both of them, same day."
Angler 'seen throwing beer bottle at seal' in Devon
An angler threw a beer bottle at a seal when it interfered with his fishing line, a charity has said.
Photos taken at Hope's Nose, near Torquay, appear to show a man hurling a projectile at the creature from a cliff.
Duncan Kenny, who took the pictures, said the grey seal was hunting when the angler emptied the bottle and launched it, hitting the animal on the back.
Mr Kenny called it "appalling and inconsiderate behaviour."
He said he was collecting litter at the Devon beauty spot with members of the Seal Project conservation charity when he witnessed the attack on Sunday morning.
"The seal made an attempt to get the fishing line," he said.
"The angler finished his beer, drained the bottle and threw it at the seal.
"The bottle hit the seal on the back and it swam off."
Mr Kenny said that "fortunately seals are robust creatures," but said the seal was simply doing what was in its nature.
"By throwing a glass bottle at it you are stopping it from hunting," he said.
The Seal Project said it was "not an isolated case" and it had received "numerous reports of this aggressive behaviour recently."
In a Facebook post, it said volunteers had collected 12 bags of rubbish during Sunday's visit to Hope's Nose and observed "multiple examples of antisocial behaviour."
All seals are protected under the Conservation of Seals Act and people are advised to stay away from them.
Serbia seeks more warplanes amid Balkan tensions
BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) - Serbia will strengthen its armed forces and is seeking to purchase more warplanes amid simmering tensions in the Balkans, the Serbian president said Sunday.
President Aleksandar Vucic said "certain initiatives" have been made to buy a fleet of fighter-bombers, accusing the U.S. and other Western countries of arming Serbia's NATO neighbors and its breakaway former province of Kosovo.
"The Americans, Turks and Germans are taking care of their beloved child," Vucic said, referring to Kosovo.
He said the U.S. has recently delivered a number of armored vehicles to Kosovo's security forces.
During a tour of a Serbian army tank brigade, Vucic said his country cannot compete with "NATO donations" to its neighbors when it comes to weapons, "therefore we must do it alone."
Vucic did not specify what type of warplanes Serbia plans to buy, but the pro-government media said his government has officially asked the U.S. for the delivery of 20 fighter-bombers.
The reports said Washington has not yet responded to Belgrade's request and that in case of a refusal, it is likely to purchase Russian-made Sukhoi-25 attack aircraft.
Serbia, which claims military neutrality, has recently received a sophisticated anti-aircraft system from Russia, which has also provided fighter jets, attack helicopters and armored vehicles.
Another Serbian ally, China, has delivered military drones.
U.S. officials have in the past spoken openly about introducing sanctions against Serbia if Moscow sends more arms to the country, especially those that could jeopardize the security of neighboring NATO-member states.
The Russian and Chinese arming of Serbia is being watched with unease in the West and among Serbia's neighbors.
Tensions are growing in the Balkans, which went through a devastating civil war in the 1990s.
NATO intervened in Serbia to stop a bloody Serb crackdown against Kosovo Albanian separatists in 1999.
Despite formally seeking to join the European Union, Serbia's populist leadership has further strengthened close political and military ties with the Kremlin, as well as Beijing.
Serbia, as well as Russia and China, don't accept Kosovo's independence, which is recognized by the U.S. and most of the West.
Seattle protesters clash with police over Trump's 'surge' of federal agents plan
Police in Seattle used flashbang grenades and pepper spray on Saturday against protesters who set fire to construction trailers outside a youth jail, amid a wave of public anger over President Donald Trump's planned "surge" of federal agents into major cities.
The sounds of repeated small detonations rang out in the streets of the city in Washington state, and smoke rose from an area where demonstrators had set fire to trailers by a construction site for the youth detention facility.
Demonstrators slashed car tires and smashed trailer windows.
Police in riot gear faced off against the demonstrators, some of whom held up umbrellas against falling pellets of pepper spray.
The Seattle Times newspaper quoted police as saying 16 people were arrested on suspicion of assault against officers, obstruction and failure to disperse.
Father-Son Arrested With Heroin Worth Rs 1.54 Crore In Mizoram
The heroin, worth around Rs 1.55 crore in the local market, was smuggled from Myanmar: Cops
A man and his son were arrested with 1.9 kg heroin in Mizoram's Hnahthial district near the Myanmar border, the police said on Sunday.
The heroin, worth around Rs 1.55 crore in the local market, was smuggled from Myanmar, they said.
Duhkima (62) and his son Remthangpuia (33) were arrested with the drugs on Friday night from Ngharchhip village, the police said.
They also dropped about Rs 280 grams of heroin, worth Rs 15 lakh, while swimming across a river as they tried to flee from the police, officials said.
According to police, the seizure was believed to be the biggest heroin haul in the state.
The accused were charged under the relevant sections of the Narcotic Drugs & Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985.
Even as the inter-state borders and the one with Myanmar remained sealed in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, smuggling of drugs and other contrabands continued unabated, the police sources said.
The Assam Rifles recently seized 25 trucks loaded with betel nuts, valued at Rs 4 crore, being smuggled from Myanmar, they said.
FDNY diversity official says 'most definitely' OK to exclude white firefighter from color guard
An FDNY diversity official has said that it's 'most definitely' acceptable to keep a white firefighter off a ceremonial color guard so the flag bearers could all be black, according to a new report.
White firefighter Lt. Daniel McWilliams filed a lawsuit claiming racial bias after he was removed from a flag-bearing unit at a November 2017 memorial mass honoring deceased members of the Vulcan Society, a fraternal society of black firefighters.
And FDNY's chief diversity and inclusion officer, lawyer Cecilia Loving, has defended the decision at a New York state Division of Human Rights trial, The New York Post reports.
McWilliams was one of the three FDNY firefighters seen in an iconic photo as they hoist the American flag at Ground Zero in the days after the 9/11 attacks.
According to McWilliams' complaint, he been selected by the FDNY Ceremonial Unit to serve as one of the flag bearers in the color guard at the memorial service.
Being a flag bearer at the event was an 'esteemed honor and privilege' for McWilliams, according to his lawsuit, CNN reported.
Upon his arrival at the event, however, McWilliams was barred from participating in the color guard by then-Vulcan Society president Regina Wilson because she allegedly had asked for an all-black color guard at the mass.
She then asked McWilliams - a 29-year FDNY veteran - to 'help in a different capacity.'
Among those duties was allegedly asking him to escort civilians and muster uniformed officers into formation away from the mass.
McWilliams claimed in his suit that he asked Wilson if she was removing him from the color guard because he's not black.
She confirmed that was the case, he said.
Wilson, a 21-year FDNY veteran who was also part of the 9/11 rescue efforts, apparently replaced McWilliams with one of the members of the Vulcan Society.
McWilliams claimed he left the memorial 'to save himself from further shame, humiliation and embarrassment,' as their exchange was overheard by friends and colleagues, the New York Daily News reported.
During her trial testimony, McWilliams' lawyer, Keith Sullivan, asked Loving - who is black - 'So, a request for an all-black color guard is not discriminatory?'
'No, it isn't,' Loving said, according to the New York Post.
Sullivan also asked Loving if it's OK to request an all-black color guard, to which she was quoted as saying, 'Most definitely.'
By way of explanation, Loving said that it was OK to swap out a white person for a black person to 'uplift our identities and our separate ethnicities in order to instill a sense of pride and community and support for one another.'
McWilliams first filed his racial bias complaint with the FDNY in January 2018.
He then filed a lawsuit against Wilson, the FDNY, the city of New York and unnamed individuals in May 2019.
After filing his complaint, Sullivan said that McWilliams was retaliated against and intimidated by Wilson's supporters.
At one point, one of her supporters allegedly laid hands on McWilliams and said: 'I've heard about you, they told me you'd act this way, and now you know me.'
In a brief, Sullivan wrote that rejecting McWilliams from the mass' color guard position was 'deplorable' and a sign of double standards in the fire department.
'If you're black and you discriminate against a white person in the workplace, you get a slap on the wrist at best,' Sullivan wrote.
Wilson, according to the lawsuit, received 'one hour of counseling' over her treatment of McWilliams.
Meanwhile, a white person who discriminates against a person of color receives 'heavy-handed discipline and punishment,' Sullivan wrote.
'The FDNY has created a policy and procedure for bending over backwards, coming up with excuses and accommodating members of the Vulcan Society ... who commit racist acts, and it has to stop,' Sullivan also wrote.
Wilfried Zaha wants to leave Crystal Palace, says Roy Hodgson: "Watch this space"
Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson dealt a blow to fans ahead of the close-season by revealing star attacker Wilf Zaha wants to leave the club.
The Ivorian international has been at Selhurst Park for over five years and now looks set to depart, having previously been linked with the likes of Arsenal and Bayern Munich.
At age 27 it remains to be seen if that calibre of club are still interested in splashing out a large fee on him, particularly this summer with the economic uncertainty in the sport, after a campaign in which Zaha scored four goals and claimed five assists for a Palace side which failed to inspire.
Speaking post-match after the final day, Hodgson told TalkSport's Alex Crook to "watch this space" regarding Zaha's probable exit after acknowledging the forward has "made it clear" he sees his future away from the club.
The forward still has three years left on his current Palace deal and they last year suggested it would take £100m to prise him away from the club.
Hodgson's side wrapped up the campaign with seven straight defeats and a final-day draw, dropping to 14th place in the process.
Zaha himself netted just once between mid-December and the end of the season, a long-range strike in a defeat to Chelsea.
He was reported to have handed in a transfer request last summer in a bid to force a move away, but a bid didn't materialise to tempt Palace to sell.
In an apparent move to boost his chances of a departure, Zaha changed agents in January and his priority for the weeks ahead will clearly be to secure a move away.
Zaha was the player to feature for the most minutes in the Premier League this season for Palace and the only member of the squad under 28 years of age to play 1,100 minutes or more, pointing to the level of rebuild which might be required in the squad with the potential fee brought in for the No 11.
Average US gas price up a penny over 2 weeks to $2.25/gallon
CAMARILLO, Calif. -- The average U.S. price of regular-grade gasoline inched up less than penny over the past two weeks to $2.25 per gallon.
That's 56 cents below the average pump price from a year ago.
Industry analyst Trilby Lundberg of the Lundberg Survey said Sunday it's the smallest rise in prices seen since late April.
She said crude oil prices have remained stable and there's an abundant supply of U.S. gasoline to meet the demand.
Nationwide, the highest average price for regular-grade gas is in the San Francisco Bay Area at $3.27 per gallon.
The lowest average is in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, at $1.79 per gallon.
The average price of diesel in the survey taken Friday held steady from two weeks earlier at $2.54 a gallon.
Dakar Youth Olympic Games delayed until 2026
The Youth Olympic Games were scheduled to take place in Dakar next year, but they have been moved to 2026 due to the coronavirus pandemic after an agreement between the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and Senegal.
The postponement of the first Olympic event to be held in Africa comes as a setback however for many young athletes.
Pedro Chelsea exit confirmed as team-mates 'serenade' forward in changing room send-off
Chelsea boss Frank Lampard has paid tribute to winger Pedro Rodriguez after making his final league appearance for the club on Sunday.
The 32-year-old penned a short-term extension to his contract to see out the season with the club but will join AS Roma on a free transfer upon the conclusion of the campaign.
The Spain international, who arrived from Barcelona back in 2015, has played a bit-part role under Lampard this season with only eight Premier League starts and 21 appearances in all competitions.
The Blues boss confirmed Pedro's departure after the west London club sealed a top-four finish with a 2-0 win over Wolves, with the veteran coming off the bench for his final appearance.
"Pedro has played his last game for the club," Lampard told Sky Sports.
"The lads have just pretty much serenaded him in the changing room and rightly so because of the career he has had generally and for this club.
"It was his last Premier League game, but the impact he has had here is huge.
I want to say a big thanks to Peds and wish him well as he goes forward.
"He is here for the remainder of games, but a big player of the club leaves and the spirit of the club I saw afterwards was pretty special."
Pedro tweeted a farewell message after the game via his Twitter account, writing: "My last game at Stamford Bridge.
Thanks to every fan for your support through these years, to the club for giving me the chance of being a Blue and to my team-mates.
You'll be in my heart forever.
Now let's fight for the FA Cup trophy!!!
BIG BLUE FAMILY."
The former Barcelona forward leaves after helping Chelsea since the title in 2017 under Antonio Conte and also won the FA Cup in 2018, as well as the Europa League a year later under Maurizio Sarri.
Heart attack: Eating chocolate once a week may reduce risk of the deadly condition
New research has pinpointed a certain indulgence may be good for the heart muscle.
What is it?  And how would it reduce the chances of a heart attack?
Researchers conducted a meta-analysis spanning five decades looking into coronary heart disease (CHD).
CHD - that also goes by the name of ischaemic heart disease - has three main symptoms: chest pain (angina), heart attacks and heart failure.
Other symptoms of the disease can include heart palpitations and unusual breathlessness.
"Chocolate contains heart-healthy nutrients such as flavonoids, methylxanthines, polyphenols and stearic acid which may reduce inflammation and increase good cholesterol."
Good cholesterol, otherwise known as high-density lipoprotein (HDL), collects "bad" cholesterol - the kind that furs up the heart's arteries - and transports it to the liver.
In the liver, "bad" (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol is broken down and excreted from the body.
However, the new study doesn't examine portion sizes, or the type of chocolate enjoyed.
It's not clear whether the participants ate dark chocolate, milk chocolate or some other cocoa confectionery.
The findings were based on previous research that concluded that consuming cocoa (found in chocolate) reduced the risk of a heart attack.
It's believed by scientists the flavonoids found in chocolate lower blood pressure and improve vascular function.
Vascular function refers to how effectively the blood delivers oxygen and nutrients throughout the body and carries away waste material.
In regards to the new research, lifestyle factors weren't highlighted in the results.
Dr Alice Lichtenstein commented on the data, suggesting that those who admitted to eating chocolate may be more likely to have "a healthy body weight."
She added that they could "regularly engage" in physical exercise and be "less stressed."
She continued: "Each factor could independently impact on cardiovascular health."
TV reporter credits viewer with noticing cancerous lump
TAMPA, Fla.  (AP) - A television news reporter in Florida is crediting an eagle-eyed viewer for noticing a lump on her neck and emailing her that she should get it checked out.
Victoria Price, a reporter for WFLA in Tampa, followed the advice and was diagnosed with cancer.
Price tweeted that she is undergoing surgery on Monday to remove the tumor, her thyroid and a couple of lymph nodes.
"Doctor said it's spreading, but not too much, and we're hopeful this will be my first and last procedure," she said.
The viewer emailed Price last month, saying the lump reminded her of one she had had.
Price, 28, an investigative reporter, said this week that her television station's catchphrase is "8 On Your Side."
"But the roles recently reversed when I found a viewer on MY side, and I couldn't be more grateful," Price said.
"I will be forever grateful for the woman who went out of her way to email me, a total stranger.
She had zero obligation to, but she did anyway.
Talk about being on your side, huh?"
Biden campaign declines 'Fox News Sunday' interview, 1 week after Chris Wallace's Trump sitdown
During his interview with Chris Wallace last week, President Trump questioned whether the Democrats' presumptive presidential nominee, Joe Biden, could handle the barrage of questioning that Wallace posed to Trump.
The answer to that question - at least for now - we may never know.
Wallace on Sunday informed viewers that the Biden campaign told Fox News he was "not available" for an interview.
"In our interview last week with President Trump, he questioned whether his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, could handle a similar encounter," Wallace said.
"This week, we asked the Biden campaign for an interview and they said the former vice president was not available."
He added, "We'll keep asking every week."
The Trump campaign has hit Biden for months for abstaining from holding rallies and news conferences while continuing to do interviews amid the coronavirus pandemic.
While Biden recently has returned to the stump, Trump and his allies continued to mock the former vice president for "hiding" in his home in Delaware.
Biden's reticence to do public events, however, has done little to hurt his candidacy as the latest polls had Biden comfortably ahead of Trump both nationally and in key battleground states.
Real Clear Politics averages indicated the president was down 7 points in Florida, 6.7 points in Pennsylvania, 8.2 points in Michigan and 6.4 points in Wisconsin.
Trump narrowly won all four states in 2016, flipping them from blue to red as he won the White House.
The latest Fox News Polls put Biden ahead in Minnesota, Michigan and Pennsylvania, with leads all outside the margin of error.
Polling also suggested Biden had a slight edge in Ohio, North Carolina and Arizona, three other important swing states this cycle.
And, surveys indicated that once reliably red states such as Texas and Georgia were all knotted up between Trump and the former vice president.
Presidential elections in which an incumbent is running for a second term in the White House are often a referendum on that president - and that's seen as being the case right now in the 2020 showdown between Trump and Biden.
The top issues have been the coronavirus and an economy flattened by the pandemic - and the president's performance and record on both issues.
Police work on timeline of Helensburgh teenager's final movements
Detectives investigating the death of a teenager in Helensburgh are trying to build a timeline of his final movements.
The body of Kirk Allan, 19, was discovered at an address in Johnson Court at about 06:25 on Saturday.
A 30-year-old man was arrested and police confirmed on Sunday that he has now been charged in connection with the death.
He is due to appear at Dumbarton Sheriff Court on Monday.
Det Insp Steve Martin said: "Our thoughts remain with Kirk's family and friends at this very difficult time.
Officers will continue to work in and around the community to provide reassurance.
"Inquiries are continuing to find out the full circumstances of what happened, in particular Kirk's movements in the days preceding his death, however, we are not looking for anyone else in connection with the death."
